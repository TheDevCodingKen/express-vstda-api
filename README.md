This repository contains the source files for my very simple to-do app (VSTDA) API.

The purpose of this project was to implement a custom Express.js application based upon a REST API contract and a mock data set.

Steps Taken:

1. Cloned my start files from GitHub
2. Installed an npm package and its dependencies
3. Created source code files
   a. to build an HTTP server using the Node API (index.js)
   b. to build an Express application (app.js)
4. Created a mock data file based upon a template
5. Imported that file as a module for the application
6. Implemented HTTP server using the Express framework
7. Exposed an endpoint that doesn't require authentication
8. Implemented GET, POST, and DELETE methods per the specifications
